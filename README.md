# meteo-svg
`meteo-svg` is an HTML file that dinamically changes an svg image, populating it with the Google Sheets API

# How it works
SVG files can be placed as inline code in an HTML file, making it easy to change its properties of any kind. In this project, I used that knowledge to change a metereology carousel, with the temperatures (and the picture itself) changing according to a table in a Google Sheets document.
